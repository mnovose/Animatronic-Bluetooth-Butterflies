# Animatronic-Bluetooth-Butterflies
We created three interactive purses, each with increasing levels of difficulty and unique objectives.
Purse 1: Featured a single butterfly with the goal of achieving smooth, natural wing movement using servo control.
Purse 2: Included two butterflies. The main challenge was providing sufficient power for both, which led us to switch to an Arduino Leonardo for improved performance.
Purse 3: Introduced Bluetooth control using an Arduino Nano ESP32 and the RemoteXY app to enable wireless interaction.
Across all three designs, we faced similar challenges involving power supply selection, wiring layout, butterfly wing attachment, and concealment of electronic components within the purse structure.
