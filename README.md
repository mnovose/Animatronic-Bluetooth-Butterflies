# Animatronic-Bluetooth-Butterflies  
Collaborators: Sophia Deng, Riya Jwalanna  
We created three interactive purses, each with increasing levels of difficulty and unique objectives.
  
 - **Purse 1:** One buttterfly - powered by Arduino Uno R3, obtained a natural movement of the wings that was smooth and varied
 - **Purse 2:** Dual butterflies - powered by Arduino Leonardo to ensure sufficiant power supply to micro servos 
 - **Purse 3:** Bluetooth control via Arduino Nano ESP32 and RemoteXY
  
 All three designs, had similar challenges involving power supply selection, wiring layout, butterfly wing attachment, and concealment of electronic components within the purse structure.

  **Hardware**  
 - Arduino Uno R3
 - Arduino Nano ESP32  
 - Arduino Leonardo  
 - GS-9018 micro servos   
 - Power supply (battery pack)  
 - Butterfly wing mechanism (servo linkage system)  

 **Software**  
 - Arduino IDE  
 - RemoteXY app (Bluetooth control)  
 - Onshape
