# Animatronic-Bluetooth-Butterflies
> We created three interactive purses, each with increasing levels of difficulty and unique objectives.
>
> - **Purse 1:** One buttterfly - powered by Arduino Uno R3, obtained a natural movement of the wings that was smooth and varied
> - **Purse 2:** Dual butterflies - powered by Arduino Leonardo to ensure sufficiant power supply to micro servos 
> - **Purse 3:** Bluetooth control via Arduino Nano ESP32 and RemoteXY
> All three designs, had similar challenges involving power supply selection, wiring layout, butterfly wing attachment, and concealment of electronic components within the purse structure.
